[float]
=== Description
The `SPISettings` object is used to configure the SPI port for your SPI device. All 3 parameters are combined to a single `SPISettings` object, which is given to `SPI.beginTransaction()`.

When all of your settings are constants, SPISettings should be used directly in `SPI.beginTransaction()`. See the syntax section below. For constants, this syntax results in smaller and faster code.

If any of your settings are variables, you may create a SPISettings object to hold the 3 settings. Then you can give the object name to SPI.beginTransaction(). Creating a named SPISettings object may be more efficient when your settings are not constants, especially if the maximum speed is a variable computed or configured, rather than a number you type directly into your sketch.

[float]
=== Syntax
`SPI.beginTransaction(SPISettings(14000000, MSBFIRST, SPI_MODE0))`
Note: Best if all 3 settings are constants

`SPISettings mySetting`
`mySetting = SPISettings(speedMaximum, dataOrder, dataMode)`
`SPI.beginTransaction(mySetting)`
Note: Best when any setting is a variable''


[float]
=== Parameters

`speedMaximum`: The maximum speed of communication. For a SPI chip rated up to 20 MHz, use 20000000. +
`dataOrder`: MSBFIRST or LSBFIRST +
`dataMode`: SPI_MODE0, SPI_MODE1, SPI_MODE2, or SPI_MODE3


[float]
=== Returns
None.
